## **Patch Notes**
- \+ Infinity session added.
- \+ Tag selection issue fixed.
- \+ Bot adding wizard design updated.
- \+ The display issue of 404/500 error pages has fixed.
- \& As you know, there were technical problems in choosing tags before, we designed a new component to fix this. In this way, the tag selection problem is completely resolved.
- \& The old bot addition wizard started to be used with the same design on another site, so we decided to make a new design. This design is simpler and more beautiful than before.
